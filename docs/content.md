### About

<p>Hello! My name is Georgi and I love creating stuff - be it for work or fun. My programming journey started when I was 12
years old with algorithm competitions and slowly evolved into a more general interest in technology and software.</p>

<p>Now as a grown-up, I am finishing my bachelor's degree and expanding my skills into areas like design, accessibility, DevOps and more. Enjoying the journey to a more complete developer.</p>

<p>My technology stack currently consists of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>JavaScript (ES6+)</li>
  <li>Vue</li>
  <li>Java</li>
  <li>Spring Boot</li>
  <li>PostgreSQL</li>
  <li>Heroku</li>
</ul>
